# ExifRename
A simple little program I wrote to recursively rename JPGs according to information in the EXIF.

Primary source: https://github.com/SammyB428/ExifRename

ExifRename.exe "InputDirectory" "OutputDirectory".

Symbolic links to the source files are created in the output directory. Output catalog format:
2020 / 2020-09-September / 2020-09-11 / 2020-09-11-03-29-16-7907661.JPG
